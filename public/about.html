<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an engineering student passionate about data structures, algorithms, and solving challenging problems in computer science. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and exploring topics like graphs, trees, and systems design. Outside of tech, I have a keen interest in sports and enjoy following fantasy leagues, which also inspires my tech projects. I love exploring mathematics and puzzles, as well as spending time outdoors or catching up on thought-provoking books and movies. My curiosity drives me to keep learning and find creative ways to connect my hobbies with my technical interests.</p>
